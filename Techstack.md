## Step-by-Step Process for Building the App

### **1. Initial Setup**
- Set up a Git repository for version control.
- Create a Docker environment for local development to ensure uniformity between development and production.
- Initialize the project with:
  - Backend: Spring Boot with Maven/Gradle.
  - Frontend: React app with Material-UI pre-installed.

---

### **2. Authentication and User Management**
1. **Backend:**
   - Use Spring Security for authentication.
   - Configure JWT for session handling.
   - Create user roles: Member, Coach, Exco, Admin.
   - Define APIs for:
     - Registration (with email verification via SendGrid/Amazon SES).
     - Login/Logout.
     - Password recovery.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use Material-UI forms for login and registration pages.
   - Implement email validation with a link to verify the user account.
   - Use JWT to handle session tokens securely.

---

### **3. Admin Panel (React Admin)**
1. **Setup:**
   - Integrate React Admin with a Material-UI theme.
   - Create resource definitions for:
     - Users: View, edit, assign roles.
     - Events: Schedule, edit, delete.
     - Financials: View payments and fines, add manual transactions.

2. **Custom Actions:**
   - Add bulk actions for approving new members or assigning fines.
   - Use pre-built charts from libraries like Recharts to visualize finances.

---

### **4. Dashboards**
1. **Backend:**
   - Create REST endpoints to aggregate data for dashboards:
     - Membership stats.
     - Financial summaries.
     - Upcoming events.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use Material-UI cards and Recharts to design dashboards.
   - Fetch data dynamically using Axios or Fetch API.

---

### **5. Voting System**
1. **Integrate Helios Voting API:**
   - Helios supports user authentication and ballot creation.
   - Backend endpoints:
     - Create a new vote.
     - Fetch current votes.
     - Submit and view results.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Create voting pages with Material-UI.
   - Display voting results visually using charts.

---

### **6. Payments and Fines**
1. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
   - Backend:
     - Use Stripe SDK or PayPal SDK for payment processing.
     - Create endpoints for:
       - Initiating payments.
       - Confirming payment success.
       - Viewing payment history.

   - Frontend:
     - Use React Stripe SDK to integrate payment forms.
     - Build a "Financial Overview" page with tables for payment/fine history.

---

### **7. Event Management**
1. **Backend:**
   - Use Hibernate to create models for events:
     - Name, Date, Time, Location, RSVP status.
   - Create APIs for:
     - Adding events.
     - Updating events.
     - Fetching events.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use FullCalendar to display events.
   - Allow RSVP actions directly within the event view.

---

### **8. Messaging System**
1. **Backend:**
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time notifications.
   - Spring Boot for managing message logs.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use Material-UI cards for message displays.
   - Include a notification center for unread messages.

---

### **9. Contact Us Page**
1. **Frontend:**
   - Build a contact form with Material-UI.
   - Use email validation and real-time error feedback.

2. **Backend:**
   - Create an API to send inquiries to the clubâ€™s email using SendGrid/Amazon SES.

---

### **10. Deployment**
1. **Containerization:**
